# Data_Analysis_Portfolio

ABOUT:

Hello! My name is JoAnna. I am a data analyst, developer, and a passionate problem solver. I specialize in Python with experience in Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Numpy. I also have experience working with SQL, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

This repository contains my portfolio of data science and data analyst projects. Each project is presented using Jupyter Notebooks. 

To take a look at these analyses, you can click on the dataset folder listed above. There you will see a folder for each portfolio project. Each folder contains the Jupyter Notebook file where the analysis was done and either the original dataset file or a link to the dataset.
