# Data_Analysis_Portfolio

## **ABOUT**:

Hello! I am a developer focusing on data analysis and visualization. I specialize in Python with experience in SQL, Tableau, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Numpy. I have certificates in Python, SQL, and Python Data Analysis and Visualization. I also have experience working with Javascript, CSS, and HTML. 

This repository contains my portfolio of data analyst projects. Each project is presented using Jupyter Notebooks. 

To take a look at these analyses, you can click on the dataset folder listed above. There you will see a folder for each portfolio project. Each folder contains the Jupyter Notebook file where the analysis was done and either the original dataset file or a link to the dataset.
