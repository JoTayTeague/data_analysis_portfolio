# data_analysis_portfolio

ABOUT:

Hello! My name is JoAnna. I am a data analyst, developer, and a passionate problem solver. I specialize in Python with experience in Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Numpy. I also have experience working with Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

This repository contains my portfolio of data science and data analyst projects. Each project is presented using Jupyter Notebooks. 

To take a look at these analyses, you can click on the dataset folder listed above. There you will see a folder for each portfolio project. Each folder contains the Jupyter Notebook file where the analysis was done, a pdf of all figures from the analysis, and a report breaking down the results of the analysis.
