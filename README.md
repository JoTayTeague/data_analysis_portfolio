# data_analysis_portfolio

Hello! My name is JoAnna. I am a data analyst, developer, and a passionate problem solver. I specialize in Python with experience in Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Numpy. I also have experience working with Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

This repository contains my portfolio of data science and data analyst projects. Each project is presented using Jupyter Notebooks.
